# Numerical-methods-1-LAB-
This program (C++) takes the hard-coded function and interpolates it in 2 different ways depending on the choice of the nodes:

  1. Uniformly distributed nodes;
  2. Chebyshev nodes

After interpolation is done, the 3 graphs are plotted in one window (initial function, interpolated functions with both nodes' choices).
The standard deviation is calculated for both interpolations and is printed both on the console and window with 3 graphs.

WARNING: GNUPLOT HAS TO BE INSTALLED IN ORDER FOR GRAPHS TO BE PLOTTED!
